## Sample Code Challenges
- [ ] Refactor this [code](https://repl.it/@ZakkMan/toRoman) to make it more readable.

  <summary><strong>Potential Answers</strong></summary> 
- Since the decimal array and the roman array are the same length and each index is tied to one another, it might make sense to make this an object instead of 2 separate arrays.
- You may also consider making the for loop a ForEach method. (Keep in mind this is technically less efficient as a process, but it is a little more readable.)
- You may also use ES6 arrow functions instead of the normal function notation.
